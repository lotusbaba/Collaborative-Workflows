With Collaborative Workflows you can prevent accidental sharing and usage of docs by capturing and displaying their workflow state, so the document collaborator knows, whether the author of the doc is requesting for document approval, whether they have all necessary approvals, whether they’ve made all changes requested, the list of reviewers, and if it’s been published.
Kaṇāda’s writings lead us to conclude that he was what we would call a theoretical physicist who validated several thought experiments.
His postulations of the laws of motion predate any other modern day scientist.
Therefore just as he set the laws of motion and perhaps inspired modern day physicists and their scientific discoveries, so do we set in motion collaborative workflows and making document reviews easier.
